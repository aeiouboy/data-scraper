## 📚 Previous Analysis (For Reference)

### **Original High-Volume Scenario (600K SKUs/Day)**
*This was the previous analysis for a much larger scale operation*

- **Daily SKUs**: 600,000
- **Monthly Total**: 18,000,000 pages
- **Required Plan**: Enterprise (custom pricing)
- **Estimated Cost**: $150,000+ per month

**Note**: Current HomePro project (68,500 products) is much smaller and more cost-effective with Standard Plan.
