#### Thai Watsadu (TWD) - ✅ Completed
- File: `app/scrapers/thaiwatsadu_scraper.py`
- Supports construction materials and tools focus
- Handles dynamic pricing and promotions

#### Global House (GH) - ✅ Completed  
- File: `app/scrapers/globalhouse_scraper.py`
- Premium furniture and home decor focus
- Advanced image filtering for quality products
- Test confirmed working with product extraction

#### DoHome (DH) - ✅ Completed
- File: `app/scrapers/dohome_scraper.py`
- Hardware and DIY tools specialist
- Handles branch-specific inventory

#### Boonthavorn (BT) - ✅ Completed
- File: `app/scrapers/boonthavorn_scraper.py`
- Ceramic tiles and sanitary ware focus
- Specialized specification extraction

#### MegaHome (MH) - ✅ Completed
- File: `app/scrapers/megahome_scraper.py`
- Electronics and appliances specialist
- Energy efficiency data extraction

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Scraping UI
Created an intuitive wizard-based scraping interface:

- **RetailerSelector Component**: Visual card-based retailer selection
- **CategorySelector Component**: Multi-select categories with search
- **ScrapingWizard Component**: 4-step guided process
- **JobProgressCard Component**: Real-time progress tracking

Key Features:
- Market position indicators
- Product count estimates
- Category specialization display
- Animated transitions (Fade, Zoom, Grow effects)

### 4. ✅ Product Matching Algorithm
File: `app/core/product_matcher.py`

Intelligent fuzzy matching system using:
- Name similarity (40% weight)
- SKU/model matching (30% weight)
- Brand normalization (20% weight)
- Price range comparison (10% weight)

Features:
- Multi-signal matching with confidence levels
- Brand alias handling (Thai/English)
- Duplicate detection within retailers
- Batch processing capabilities

### 5. ✅ Monitoring Dashboard
File: `frontend/src/pages/Monitoring.tsx`

Comprehensive health monitoring system:
- Overall system health status
- 24h/7d success rate tracking
- Real-time job metrics
- Per-retailer health indicators
- Interactive charts (Chart.js)
- Auto-refresh capabilities
- Alert system for issues

Backend: `app/api/routers/monitoring.py`
- Health metrics endpoint
- Retailer-specific statistics
- Hourly job metrics for visualization
- Active alert detection

### 6. ✅ Rate Limiting System
File: `app/core/rate_limiter.py`

Advanced rate limiting with:
- **Token bucket algorithm** for burst handling
- **Per-retailer configurations**
- **Priority queue system** (high/normal/low)
- **Concurrent request limits**
- **Adaptive delays** based on errors
- **Statistics tracking**

Retailer-specific limits configured:
- HP: 2 req/s, burst 10, concurrent 5
- TWD: 1.5 req/s, burst 8, concurrent 3
- GH: 0.5 req/s, burst 5, concurrent 4
- DH: 1 req/s, burst 5, concurrent 5
- BT: 0.7 req/s, burst 3, concurrent 3
- MH: 0.5 req/s, burst 3, concurrent 3

### 7. ✅ Data Quality Validation
File: `app/core/data_validator.py`

Comprehensive validation system checking:
- Required fields presence
- SKU format validation
- Name quality (length, price info, repeated chars)
- Price logic and ranges by category
- Brand normalization suggestions
- Category validation
- URL domain matching
- Image URL validation
- Availability status
- Specification quality

Quality scoring system:
- 0.0 to 1.0 scale
- Weighted deductions for issues
- Bonus points for completeness
- Batch validation summaries

## Key Achievements

1. **Unified Multi-Retailer System**: All 6 major retailers integrated with consistent interfaces
2. **Intelligent Matching**: Cross-retailer product matching with ML/fuzzy algorithms
3. **Production-Ready Monitoring**: Real-time health tracking and alerting
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Rate limiting and queueing for sustainable operations
5. **Data Quality Assurance**: Automated validation ensuring high-quality data
6. **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive wizard-based UI for non-technical users
