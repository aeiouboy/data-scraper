## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Anti-Detection Strategy (Price2Spy Method)**
```python
class Price2SpyStyleScraper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.proxy_pool = ResidentialProxyPool()
        self.user_agents = UserAgentRotator()
        self.rate_limiter = AdaptiveRateLimiter()
        self.success_monitor = SuccessRateMonitor(target=0.995)
    
    async def scrape_with_protection(self, url, tier):
        proxy = self.proxy_pool.get_random()
        headers = self.user_agents.get_random()
        
        await self.rate_limiter.acquire(tier)
        
        try:
            result = await self.protected_request(url, proxy, headers)
            self.success_monitor.record_success(tier)
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.success_monitor.record_failure(tier)
            return await self.retry_with_backoff(url, tier)
```

### **Dynamic Tier Management**
```python
def analyze_price_volatility(product_history):
    """Calculate price volatility to determine optimal monitoring tier"""
    price_changes = calculate_price_changes(product_history)
    volatility_score = calculate_volatility_score(price_changes)
    
    if volatility_score > 0.15:  # 15% volatility
        return "ultra_critical"
    elif volatility_score > 0.08:  # 8% volatility
        return "high_value"
    elif volatility_score > 0.03:  # 3% volatility
        return "standard"
    else:
        return "low_priority"
```

### **Quality Monitoring (Price2Spy Standard)**
```python
class QualityMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.success_rate_targets = {
            "ultra_critical": 0.995,
            "high_value": 0.99,
            "standard": 0.95,
            "low_priority": 0.90
        }
    
    def monitor_tier_performance(self, tier, results):
        success_rate = calculate_success_rate(results)
        target = self.success_rate_targets[tier]
        
        if success_rate < target:
            self.trigger_quality_improvement(tier)
            self.adjust_retry_strategy(tier)
